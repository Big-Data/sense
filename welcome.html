<h4>Here are a few of words to get you oriented quickly</h4>

<p>Sense is split into two panes: the left/white pane where you type requests to send to Elasticsearch,
    and the right/black pane where the responses are be displayed.</p>

<p>Sense understands requests in a compact format, similar to cURL:
<div id="example_editor_container"></div>

<p>While typing a request, Sense will make suggestions which you can than accept by hitting Enter/Tab.
    These suggestions are made based on the request structure <i>as well as</i> your indices and types.
</p>


<h4>A few of quick tips, while I have your attention</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Submit requests to ES using the green triangle button.</li>

    <li>You can resize the editor and output panes by dragging the separator between them.</li>
    <li>Study the keyboard shortcuts under the Help button. Good stuff in there!</li>
</ul>
