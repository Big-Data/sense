<h4>Here are a couple of words to get you oriented quickly</h4>

<p>Sense's screen is split into two panes. The left white pane is where you can type requests to send to Elasticsearch.
    The right black pane is where you see responses.</p>

<p>Sense understands requests in a compact format, similar to cURL:
<div id="example_editor_container"></div>

<p>While typing a request, Sense will make suggestions which you can than accept by hitting Enter/Tab.
    These suggestions are made based on the request structure <i>and</i> your indices and types.
</p>


<h4>A couple of quick tips, while I have your attention</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Submit requests to ES using the green triangle button.</li>
    <li>Use the wrench menu for other useful things.</li>
    <li>You can paste requests in cURL format and they will be translated to the Sense syntax.</li>
    <li>You can resize the editor and output panes by dragging the separator between them.</li>
    <li>Do study the keyboard shortcuts under the Help button. Good stuff in there.</li>
</ul>
